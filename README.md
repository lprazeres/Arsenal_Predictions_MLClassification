# Arsenal_Predictions_MLClassification

This project analyzes Arsenal's match results over the past seven full seasons to identify key factors that influence match outcomes (win, draw, or loss). Using Python, I explored the dataset and applied various machine learning techniques to determine the most effective model for predicting game results.

Skills Demonstrated:

Data Collection & Cleaning: Extracted and processed match data to ensure consistency and accuracy.

Feature Engineering: Identified critical game attributes that influence match outcomes.

Machine Learning Models: Implemented and evaluated multiple classification models: Decision Tree, Random Forest, Logistic Regression, and Neural Networks,

Model Evaluation: Applied performance metrics such as: F1-Score, Recall, and Precision.

Key Findings:

The Random Forest model proved to be the most accurate and reliable for predicting match outcomes.

Results highlight that Arsenal should prioritize investments in goal-scoring efficiency and goalkeeper performance to improve their winning chances.

Additionally, the analysis revealed a higher number of losses during the winter season, emphasizing the need for a strategic player rotation plan to reduce fatigue and maintain performance levels.

Tools Used:

Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn)

Data Visualization for insights and recommendations

This project showcases my expertise in data analysis, machine learning, and strategic decision-making to address real-world business challenges.
